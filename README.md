YT2MP3
======

A simple java application to convert youtube videos into mp3 audio format.

Usage:
Create a text file with video ID's.
A video ID is what occurs after the youtube url.

Like so: http://youtube.com/watch?v=IDISHERE
Copy the ID's into a text file, and save the file.

Now, simply launch the program, follow the steps, and you should be good.
You may encounter a couple IO errors, as well as Connection errors.

This bugs are based on the website, and your connection. There is nothing I can really do about it.
